    "text": "Data Analysis\n\nFemale and Male Employment in Agriculture, Industry, and Services\n“How does female and male employment differ based on business sector?”\nWhether or not a woman is employed is not the only factor I am considering when looking at the differences in female and male employment. The industry in which a woman is employed is also important. If one with no prior knowledge of this topic were to consider the question above, they might answer that there is no difference, and women and men are employed in all sectors. However, based on my previous experience that might not be entirely true. In the following graph, I explore female and male employment in three different business sectors (agriculture, industry, and service), based on income status.\n\n#List of 'Country Name' values that involve groups of countries in different income classes\nincomes = ['Low income', 'Lower middle income', 'MIC', 'Upper middle income', 'High income']\n\n#Filter dataset to only include relevant data\ndf = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'].str.contains('Employment in ')]\ndf = df[~df['Indicator Name'].str.contains('total employment')]\ndf = df[df['Country Name'].isin(incomes)]\ndf = df.replace(\"MIC\", \"Middle income\")\n\n#Create and display a bar graph using plotly\nfig = px.bar(df, x=\"Country Name\", y=\"Value\",\n           color='Indicator Name', hover_name='Indicator Name', barmode='group',\n           animation_frame=\"Year\",\n          labels={\n                     \"Country Name\": \"Income level\",\n                     \"Indicator Name\": \"Industry and Gender Descriptor\",\n                     \"Value\": \"% of Employment\"\n                 },)\nfig.update_layout(legend=dict(\n    orientation=\"h\",\n    yanchor=\"bottom\",\n    y=1.02,\n    xanchor=\"right\",\n    x=1\n))\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThis visualization contrasts the percentage of men and women employed in three different sectors of business: agriculture, industry, and services. The data was collected from different countries around the world, grouped by income status. From this graph, it can be seen that in every income group, the percentage of men in each business sector surpasses the percentage of women in the same sector. Thus, in total, men are present in business more than women. More specifically, we can see patterns forming, based on the women in different income groups. In higher-income groups, women are most likely to be working in the service industry. However, in lower-income groups, women are most likely to be working in the agriculture industry. Thus, we can see that income influences the type of employment that women achieve.\nOverall, we can clearly see that women, regardless of income class, are more likely to be working in the service industry, than men in the same income class. On the other hand, regardless of income, men are more likely to be working in industry. Thus, regardless of income, there are still differences in the business sector that men and women are employed in.\nNote: to clarify, this data was collected by grouping countries into income levels (low income to high income), then reporting the compiled data from each of these countries. It does not account for income disparities within a country.\n\n\nEffects of Maternity Leave on Female Labor Force\nThe first major issue I can think of that might have an impact on the differences in female and male employment is maternity leave. Whether or not a woman is supported during her maternity leave would have a notable effect on her willingness and ability to rejoin the labor force. In the following graph, I explore the effects of the length of maternity leave on female participation in the labor force.\n\n# Filter dataset to only include relevant data\ndf1 = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Length of paid maternity leave (calendar days)']\ndf1 = df1[df1['Year'] == 2022]\ndf1 = df1[['Country Name', 'Value']].copy()\n#print(df1.sort_values(by=['Value']))\n\n\n# Filter dataset to only include relevant data\n# Note: I had to do a slightly more complicated than regular way of filtering, \n# because I needed to get the latest data from each country.\n\nindices = []\n\nprev_country = \"\"\nfor index, row in employ_df.iterrows():\n  indic = row['Indicator Name']\n  country = row['Country Name']\n  if(indic == 'Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (national estimate)'):\n    if (country != prev_country):\n      indices.append(index)\n      prev_country = country\n    \ndf2 = employ_df.iloc[indices]\ndf2 = df2[['Country Name', 'Value']].copy()\n\n#print(df)\n#print(df2.sort_values(by=['Value']).to_string())\n\n\n#Create and display both maps\ndef addTooltip(m):\n  style_function = lambda x: {'fillColor': '#ffffff', \n                            'color':'#000000', \n                            'fillOpacity': 0.1, \n                            'weight': 0.1}\n  highlight_function = lambda x: {'fillColor': '#000000', \n                                  'color':'#000000', \n                                  'fillOpacity': 0.50, \n                                  'weight': 0.1}\n  NIL = folium.features.GeoJson(\n      geo,\n      style_function=style_function, \n      control=False,\n      highlight_function=highlight_function, \n      tooltip=folium.features.GeoJsonTooltip(\n          fields=['NAME_EN','INCOME_GRP'],  # use fields from the json file\n          aliases=['Country: ','Income: '],\n          style=(\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; padding: 10px;\") \n      )\n  )\n  m.add_child(NIL)\n  m.keep_in_front(NIL)\n  folium.LayerControl().add_to(m)\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[40,0], zoom_start=2)\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=geo,\n    data=df1,\n    columns=[\"Country Name\", \"Value\"],\n    key_on=\"feature.properties.NAME_EN\",\n    legend_name=\"There is paid parental leave (1=yes; 0=no)\",\n    fill_color=\"Reds\",\n).add_to(m)\naddTooltip(m)\ndisplay(m)\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[40,0], zoom_start=2)\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=geo,\n    data=df2,\n    columns=[\"Country Name\", \"Value\"],\n    legend_name=\"Female Labor Force Participation Rate (%)\",\n    key_on=\"feature.properties.NAME_EN\",\n    fill_color=\"Blues\",\n).add_to(m)\naddTooltip(m)\ndisplay(m)\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\nLength of Maternity Leave\nThe first map is a map of the length of maternity leave (in days) in different countries. The data is represented by a scale of light pink to dark red. A short maternity leave is represented by the light pink, while dark red represents a long maternity leave. From just looking at the map, one can tell that most of the countries have quite short paid maternity leaves. In fact, there are 11 countries that have 0 days of paid maternity leave, including the US. The longest maternity leave is San Marino (a small country surrounded by Italy) with 635 days.\n\n\nFemale Labor Force Participation\nThe second map is a map of the female labor force participation in different countries. The percentages are represented by a scale of light blue to dark blue. A low percentage (light blue) means that of all the female population ages 15+, a small amount of them participate in the labor force. Similarly, a high percentage (dark blue) means that a large amount of women ages 15+ participate in the labor force. There is no discernible pattern to the percentage of female labor force participation. However, what we can see is that the participation rate does not reach 100% for any country, even the ones classified as ‘high income’, such as the US. In fact, the highest participation rate is San Marino at 87.59%. The lowest is Yemen, at 6.04%. The US is around the middle at 56.79%.\n\n\nConnection\nThere is no immediately discernible connection between the length of paid maternity leave and high female labor force participation. However, when looking at the countries that have the highest participation rate, there is some connection. Specifically, it is interesting that San Marino has both the highest labor force participation rate as well as the longest paid maternity leave. Unfortunately, these maps do not show much of a correlation between the length of paid maternity leave and female labor force participation. Thus, there must be other factors that affect female participation in the labor force.\n\n\n\nEffects of Contraceptive Prevalence on Female Labor Force in US\nSimilar to my intuition about the effect of maternity leave on female labor force participation, I was also curious about the effects of contraception on women in the labor force. Access to contraception allows women more freedom in their lives, not being beholden to the complications of unwanted pregnancies. I would assume that with the increase of contraception, more women would begin working. In the following graph, I explore the effects of contraception prevalence on female participation in the labor force.\n\n#Filter and merge datasets to only include relevant data\ncontra = health_df[health_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Contraceptive prevalence, any modern method (% of married women ages 15-49)']\nlabor = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (national estimate)']\nmen = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15+) (national estimate)']\n\n\ndf = pd.concat([contra, labor])\ndf = pd.concat([df, men])\ndf = df[(df['Country Name'].eq('United States'))]\n\n#Create and display line graph using plotly\nfig = px.line(df, x=\"Year\", y=\"Value\", color='Indicator Name', hover_name=\"Indicator Name\", \n              labels={\n                     \"Indicator Name\": \"Factor\",\n                     \"Value\": \"% of population\"\n                 },)\nfig.update_layout(legend=dict(\n    orientation=\"h\",\n    yanchor=\"bottom\",\n    y=1.02,\n    xanchor=\"right\",\n    x=1\n))\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThis graph compares the evolution over time of female labor force participation in the US to the contraceptive prevalence in the US. We can see some individual patterns for each factor. For contraceptive prevalence, there is a sharp increase in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, there is a sharp decline in the mid 1970s, eventually stabilizing from 1980 until now. For female labor force participation, there is a slow increase from 1960 to around 2000 where it peaks, before beginning a slight decine until now.\nThus at first glance, we can see that there was a correlation between the two factors, at least in the 1960s and 1970s. However, now there does not seem to be a connection, as even when contraceptive prevalence had a slight peak in 2016, the female participation rate essentially stayed the same.\nOriginally, I had only included the female labor force participation rate in this graph. However, as I was writing up my analysis, I found that I was curious about the comparison between the male and female labor force participation rate. When accounting for that, the connection between contraception prevalence and the female participation rate becomes stronger. This is because it is clear that the male labor force participation rate was not affected at all by the change in contraceptive prevalence.\nNote: the data collected for contraceptive prevalence was taken from the population of married women from ages 15-49. Thus, there might be a different conclusion to glean if we had access to this same data from the population of all women.\n\n\nFemale Employment in India and the US\nAnother facet of employment is leadership opportunities available for women. I wanted to not only explore the relationship between female leaders and overall female employment, but I also wanted to explore it further. To carry on the theme of following policies surrounding maternal health and discrimination, I found countries with differences in their policies surrounding pregnant women. Two such countries are India and the US. While they are similar in terms of political systems, the US prohibits the dismissal of pregnant workers, while India doesn’t. In the following graph, I explore the evolution of female labor force participation as well as female presence in management over time in both the US and India.\n\n#Filter and merge datasets to only include relevant data\ndismiss = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Dismissal of pregnant workers is prohibited (1=yes; 0=no)']\ndismiss = dismiss[['Country Name', 'Year', 'Value']].copy()\ndismiss.columns = ['Country Name', 'Year', 'Dismissal of pregnant workers is prohibited (1=yes; 0=no)']\n\nfemale = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Labor force, female']\nfemale = female[['Country Name', 'Year', 'Value']].copy()\nfemale.columns = ['Country Name', 'Year', 'Labor force, female']\n\nmanage = employ_df[employ_df['Indicator Name'] == 'Female share of employment in senior and middle management (%)']\nmanage = manage[['Country Name', 'Year', 'Value']].copy()\nmanage.columns = ['Country Name', 'Year', 'Female share of employment in senior and middle management (%)']\n\ndf = female[['Country Name', 'Year']].copy()\ndf = pd.merge(df, female, on = ['Country Name',  'Year'], how = \"inner\")\ndf = pd.merge(df, dismiss, on = ['Country Name',  'Year'], how = \"inner\")\ndf = pd.merge(df, manage, on = ['Country Name',  'Year'], how = \"inner\")\n\n\n#Create and display line graph using plotly\ndf1 = df[(df['Country Name'] == \"United States\")]\n\nsubfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\": True}]])\n\nfig1 = px.line(df1, x=\"Year\", y='Labor force, female', title=\"US\")\nfig1.update_traces(yaxis=\"y2\")\n\nfig2 = px.line(df1, x=\"Year\", y='Female share of employment in senior and middle management (%)')\n\nsubfig.add_traces(fig1.data + fig2.data)\nsubfig.layout.xaxis.title=\"Year\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis.title=\"% of Women in Management\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis2.type=\"log\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis2.title=\"Female Labor Force (log value)\"\nsubfig.for_each_trace(lambda t: t.update(line=dict(color=t.marker.color)))\nsubfig.update_layout(title_text=\"United States\")\nsubfig.show()\n\n#Create and display line graph using plotly\ndf2 = df[(df['Country Name'] == \"India\")]\n\nsubfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\": True}]])\n\nfig1 = px.line(df2, x=\"Year\", y='Labor force, female')\nfig1.update_traces(yaxis=\"y2\")\n\nfig2 = px.line(df2, x=\"Year\", y='Female share of employment in senior and middle management (%)')\n\nsubfig.add_traces(fig1.data + fig2.data)\nsubfig.layout.xaxis.title=\"Year\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis.title=\"% of Women in Management\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis2.type=\"log\"\nsubfig.layout.yaxis2.title=\"Female Labor Force (log value)\"\nsubfig.for_each_trace(lambda t: t.update(line=dict(color=t.marker.color)))\nsubfig.update_layout(title_text=\"India\")\nsubfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThese graphs show the evolution of female labor force and female share of management. The female share of management (red) is recorded as the percentage of women of the total employment in senior and middle management. The female labor force (blue) is recorded as the number of women participating in the labor force. As the population numbers for both these countries are quite large, I had to graph the female labor force values on a logarithmic scale.\nAt first glance, both of these graphs look quite different. However upon further inspections, there are some insights to be gleaned from these graphs.\nFor the US, the evolution of female labor force participation and female share of management seem to be changing at a similar rate. Both seem to be increasing pretty steadily over time. However, for India, both seem to be changing at different rates. From 2010 to 2018, while the percentage of women in management is increasing, the female labor force is decreasing. There does not seem to be as clear a pattern as there was for the US.\nHowever, if we look at the specific values, we can learn something intriguing. For female management, India at its highest (17.3% in 2020) is still much less than the US at its lowest (36.9% in 2006). Thus, the dismissal policies for pregnant women might have had a general impact on women in management. However, there is not enough information to ascribe that as the cause for the discrepancies between these countries.\nFor reference the population of India in 2021 was 1.408 billion, while the population of the US in 2021 was 331.9 million. This means that of the entire population of India, at its largest only about 12% are women in the workforce, while in the US, 23% of the population are women in the workforce. Thus, this could mean that there are other factors than anti-discrimination policies that have an impact on female employment (for both the labor force and female management).\nNote: there were severe limiting factors for this visualization. With both the data given in the dataset, and the tools I had access to, I was not able to graph this visualization in as clear a manner as I would have wanted. In addition, I would have wanted to compare these values for a single country that changed its dismissal policies, but that data was not available in the dataset. With more information, perhaps a more significant conclusion could have been drawn."
